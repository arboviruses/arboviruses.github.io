## Summary of meeting

This is a two day meeting to bring together international researchers with an interest in tackling emerging viruses that affect all species, whether human, pet, production or wild.  This will allow cross-fertilisation of ideas and common trends to be identified, as well as discussion of methodologies and prospects going forward.

## Proposed Sessions

- Gastrointestinal Infections
- Respiratory Infections
- Systemic Infections
- Drivers of Emerging Infections

We are interested in hearing about all aspects of emerging viral infections from pathogenesis in different host species, interaction with vectors, diagnostic methods and treatments as well as wider environmental impacts on viral spread.

## Venue
